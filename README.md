<h2>Genomic Benchmarking for Sequence Classification and Exercise in 
Reproducibility<h2>

### Abstract
As deep learning continues to become increasingly prevalent it is important
to maintain the ability of repeatability. In biosciences, especially in the 
field of genomics and handling the large datasets of genomic sequences; 
benchmarking has became a very valuable tool for sequence classification for 
repeatable experiments.This paper will examine a selection of genomic sequences
for classification with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks with a 
walkthrough the implementation details and drawbacks of using unmaintained code
bases for repeatable experiments.
